Has OpenAI’s moat dried up, or does the AI leader\n have something special up its sleeve before the end of the year? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOGETHER WITH EIGHT SLEEP\n\n\n\n\n Sleep\n with AI-powered precision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rundown: Eight Sleep's Pod 4 Ultra is redefining sleep by combining AI, biometrics, and personalized climate control for the ultimate night’s rest —  bringing lab-grade sleep optimization\n to your bedroom.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pod 4 Ultra offers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·       \nAI-driven temperature adjustments throughout the night\n\n·       \nDetailed sleep analytics and daily sleep fitness scores\n\n·       \nAdvanced snore detection with automatic bed adjustments\n\n\n\n\n\nUse code \nRUNDOWN at \neightsleep.com/rundown for up to\n$600 off bundled purchases through December 14th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI2\n\n\n\n\n AI2\n launches fully open Llama competitor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: AI2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rundown:\nResearch institute AI2 just \nreleased OLMo 2, a new family of fully open-source language models that matches the performance of similar-sized competitors like Meta’s Llama.\n\n\n\n\nThe details:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·       \nThe 7B and 13B models were trained on a 5T token dataset of high-quality academic content, filtered web data, and specialized instruction sources.\n\n\n·       \nThe OLMo models achieved similar or better results while using less computing power than competitors and being smaller in size.\n\n\n·       \nThe models are fully open, with AI2 providing access to source code, training data, and a dev package with training recipes and evaluation frameworks.\n\n·       \nThe release also includes instruction-tuned variants, which achieve competitive results against leading open models like Qwen 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy it matters: While other open-source models release weights but remain heavily guarded, OLMo 2 proves that cutting-edge AI can be developed and released completely in the open — potentially\n setting a powerful new standard for how future systems are built and shared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI TRAINING\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate\n live web prototypes with Qwen Artifacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rundown: Qwen2.5-Coder’s new Artifact feature instantly transforms your web ideas into live, interactive prototypes.\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.    \nVisit Hugging Face and locate the Qwen2.5-Coder-Artifacts\n\nspace.\n\n2.    \nEnter your prototype description with specific design requirements.\n\n3.    \nClick \"Send\" to generate and preview your prototype instantly.\n\n4.    \nRefine the design and export the code for your project.\n\n\n\n\n\nPro tip: Start with basic layouts and gradually add features to build complex prototypes efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI RESEARCH\n\n\n\n\n AI\n outperforms experts at predicting scientific results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Ideogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rundown:\nA new study from the University College of London just \nrevealed that AI systems can predict scientific outcomes significantly better than expert neuroscientists — also uncovering ‘hidden’ patterns in research that could help better guide future studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe details: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n·       \nA ‘BrainBench’ tool was used to test 15 AI models and 171 neuroscience experts’ ability to distinguish real vs. fake outcomes in research abstracts.\n\n·       \nThe AI models achieved 81% accuracy, compared to 63% for the experts — with a ‘BrainGPT’ trained on neuroscience papers scoring even higher at 86%.\n\n\n·       \nThe success suggests scientific research follows more discoverable patterns than previously thought, which AI can leverage to guide future experiments.\n\n·       \nThe researchers are developing tools to help scientists validate experimental designs before conducting studies, potentially saving time and resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy it matters: \nWhile AI's pattern recognition capabilities aren't surprising, its ability to predict scientific outcomes could completely change how research is conducted. Using AI to validate experiments before spending any time in the lab could lead to faster research cycles,\n fewer dead ends, and accelerated scientific breakthroughs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW TOOLS & JOBS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n AI Tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·       \n Magic\n Roll - Create viral shorts in one click with B-roll, motion graphics, and AI-powered captions\n\n·       \n OfferGenie\n - AI-powered career copilot with real-time guidance to ace every interview\n\n·       \n Runway\n Frames - A new foundation model for image generation with style precision and visual world-building.\n\n·       \n\n\nFoundry - Build, evaluate, and improve AI agents that can automate key parts of your business\n\n·       \n Llms.txt\n Generator - Generate an llms.txt file for your website to provide information to help LLMs use your website at inference time\n\n\n\n\n\nNew\n AI Job Opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·       \n The\n Rundown - Head of Growth\n\n·       \n\n\nShield AI - Manufacturing Engineer\n\n·       \n Cresta\n - Sales Development Representative, New York\n\n·       \n Writer\n - Director, AI Research\n\n·       \n Deepmind\n - Research Engineer, Materials Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI \ntemporarily suspended\n access to Sora for beta testers following Tuesday’s \nleak, with a group of artists creating an unauthorized public interface to the AI video tool.\n\n\n\n\nxAI \nreportedly plans\n to release a standalone app to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT as early as December, marking the company’s first product outside of the X platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nH Company showcased\n new demos of its Runner H agent, performing advanced web tasks, including real-time data extraction, complex interface navigation, and precision web scraping across multiple platforms.\n\n\n\n\nElevenLabs\nintroduced\n GenFM podcasts, a new feature that allows users to generate AI-hosted conversations in 32 languages about uploaded PDFs, articles, eBooks, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk posted\n on X that he plans to start an AI game studio with xAI, saying he wants to “make games great again.”\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese self-driving startup Pony AI\nraised\n $260M at a $4.5B valuation as the autonomous taxi company’s U.S. IPO goes live for trading this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHAT’S A WRAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it for today!\nBefore you go we’d love to know what you thought of today's newsletter to help us improve The Rundown experience for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n️️️️️\n Nailed it \n \n\n\n\n\n\n️️️\n Average \n \n\n\n\n\n\n️\n Fail \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you soon,\n\n\n\n\nRowan,\n\nJoey...[Message clipped]  View entire message"
