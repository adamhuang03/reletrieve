By focusing on video analysis capabilities, Amazon is\n targeting a relatively untapped market segment that could appeal to sports analytics, media companies, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOGETHER WITH INNOVATING WITH AI\n\n\n\n\n Start\n your career as an AI Consultant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rundown: Innovating with AI’s new program, AI Consultancy Project, equips AI enthusiasts with all the resources to capitalize on the rapidly growing AI consulting market – which is set to 8x\n to $54.7B by 2032.\n\n\n\n\nThe program offers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools and framework to find clients and deliver top-notch services\n\nA 6-month roadmap to build a 6-figure AI consulting business\n\nStudent landing their first AI client in as little as 3 days\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick\n here to request early access to The AI Consultancy Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTESLA\n\n\n\n\n Tesla's\n Optimus gets major hand upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rundown: Tesla just\nshowcased\n its humanoid robot Optimus with an upgraded hand, demonstrating new capabilities like catching balls in real-time — a significant leap in robotic dexterity.\n\n\n\n\nThe details:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new hand-forearm system includes 22 degrees of freedom in the hand and 3 in the wrist/forearm, doubling previous capabilities.\n\nAll actuation mechanisms have been moved to the forearm, though this has also increased its weight.\n\nThe Tesla Optimus team is working on integrating extended tactile sensing, fine tendon controls, and reducing forearm weight by year-end.\n\nWhile the demo was tele-operated (remote controlled), achieving smooth and accurate tendon control represents a complex engineering achievement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy it matters: More robotic dexterity brings us closer to humanoid robots that can perform human-like tasks with precision. Catching a ball might seem simple, but achieving this level of hand\n coordination in a robot requires an incredible amount of hardware engineering. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI TRAINING\n\n\n\n\n Create\n an AI agent with Internet access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rundown: Using Mistral AI's free agent feature (the ChatGPT competitor from France), you can now create a custom writing assistant with Internet access that matches your unique writing style,\n tone, and structure.\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit\nMistral\n AI and create a free account.\n\nCreate a new agent and select \"Pixtral Large\" model.\n\nInput your writing style instructions and examples.
